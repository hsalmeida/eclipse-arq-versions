EstimateChanges.About2=The Team Area and Iteration parameters filter the displayed work items to those owned by the specified teams and planned for the specified iteration. A boolean parameter allows you to indicate whether an estimate change where the old value is "0" should be displayed (these may be considered not "real" estimate changes, since they usually indicate the initial estimation). The optional "From" and "To" parameters act as a date scope on the results.
EstimateChanges.About1=This report shows a list of all work items whose estimates have been changed. This can be useful for after-the-fact diagnosis of how the scope, or amount of work, for an iteration has changed.

EstimatedVsActualWork.About4=A ratio considerably greater than 1.0. This may indicate that the time estimates are becoming too high and some modifications need to be made when making such estimates in the future.
EstimatedVsActualWork.About3=Only work items which are closed and which have both an estimate value and a time spent value specified are included in the calculation.
EstimatedVsActualWork.About2=Ideally, a ratio over time of very close to 1.0 is considered good; this means that the estimates were very realistic.
EstimatedVsActualWork.About1=This report plots the ratio of estimated vs. actual work of a team over time. On each work item, one can specify a time estimate and, after the fact, the time actually spent. The ratio is defined as the estimated time divided by the actual time for all closed work items.

Resolved defects are defined as those in the Resolved state (the same as "In Test" in the third chart). Closed defects are defined as those in the Closed state.
SVT.About8=The fourth chart and table plot the new defects versus the number of newly-closed defects during a timeframe. New defects are defined as those which are newly-created in the specified timeframe. Specifically, this means that re-opened defects are not included in the "new defects" count. Closed defects are defined as those which enter the Closed state during the specified timeframe. Note that it is possible for the same defect to enter the Closed state more than once, in the case of re-opening and re-closing.
SVT.About7=The third chart and table plot the defect backlog as discrete samples. Defects which are in states New, Reopened, Triaged or In Progress are considered "In Development". There is no concept of "Awaiting Info" status, so such defects are not excluded from the count. Defects which are in the state "Resolved" are considered "In Test".
SVT.About6=The second chart and table plot discovered defects during a timeframe. These are defined as defects which are newly created in the specified timeframe. Specifically, this means that re-opened defects are not included, but defects which get marked as duplicates are included.
SVT.About5=The first chart and table plot active defects as discrete samples. These are defined as being in one of the following states\: New, Resolved, Triaged, In Progress, Resolved.
SVT.About4=In general, no special handling is given to defects marked as duplicates. That is, duplicate defects are included in the counts just like other defects.
SVT.About3=Only work items of type "Defect" are considered. SVT defects are typically identified using a tag. The specified tag parameter acts as a filter, and "svt" is the default tag used.
SVT.About2=All data is aggregated on a weekly basis. Weeks begin on Sunday. For cumulative data (such as as number of new work items in a week), the sum of the values from Sunday through Saturday are used. For sampled data (such as the number of open work items), the first sample point in the week is used (the data warehouse usually samples data once a day, so a Sunday sample should be available except for cases of server downtime). If the specified "From" date is not a Sunday, then cumulative data is aggregated from the From date to the following Sunday (resulting in a shorter first week), and for sampled data the first available sample starting at the From date is used.
SVT.About1=This report plots a variety of work item metrics that System Verification Test (SVT) teams can use to track their progress.
DefectDiscoveryRate.About4=A trend which does not decrease as the ship date approaches, which could be an indication of quality issues.

ERROR_NO_RELEASE_SELECTED=ERROR\: This report will generate a burndown chart for a single release, but you have not selected a release (an RTC iteration that has a project release plan).  Please re-run the report and choose a single release together with all its child iterations.
ABOUT5=The prediction lines are plotted for the current and all future iterations by calculating the optimistic (average of best three iteration velocities from last six iterations), best guess (average of most recent three velocities) and pessimistic (average of worst three iteration velocities from last six iterations).
ABOUT4=An ideal line is plotted to indicate how much work 'should' be done in each iteration to complete all complexity points by the end of the release - as identified by the end date of the 'release' iteration.
ABOUT3=The report identifies the 'release' iteration by looking for an iteration from the selected parameters that has one or more plans of type "Release Plan (Project)".  It calculates the total amount of work in the release by adding all of the complexity points for each of the top level work items owned by the selected team areas and targeted for the selected iterations.  The velocity for each iteration is calculated by adding up all the complexity points for top level work items that have been marked as resolved for each completed iteration.  This iteration velocity is then subtracted from the previous remaining complexity to create the burndown line. The stacked bars showed how many complexity points of each priority were remaining at the end of each iteration.
ABOUT2=The chart is mostly generated from live data.  The only exception is the list of teams and iterations, which are retrieved from the data warehouse. So if you add new teams or iterations, you must either wait for the nightly snapshot, or run an on-demand snapshot in order to see your new iterations.
ABOUT1=This release burndown chart shows how much work, as measured using the defined complexity attribute, has been done in each completed iteration.  It also attempts to predict how much work will be remaining in future iterations based on existing release scope and previous velocity.  This allows teams to determine whether they are on track to deliver the release on time.
UNKNOWN_RELEASE_ITERATION_MESSAGE=* INFO\: This burndown report will create predictions based on release backlog size in complexity points and previous velocity.  To create the full chart, ensure that you have specified an end date for the release and that you have created and selected iterations up to the release end date.  Note that if you create new iterations, you must also update the data warehouse snapshots for this report to recognize those new iterations.
